TALES FROM NIRN: MORROWIND
Currently a work-in-progress, our Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind roleplay server uses TES3MP, a brilliant multiplayer tool, as well as Wabbajack in order to overhaul the game to be more accessible for the newer generation of Elder Scrolls players, whilst retaining the same nostalgic feel Morrowind veterans have always loved. Both new and veteran players will be able to finally connect in a game that many would say defined the RPG genre.
